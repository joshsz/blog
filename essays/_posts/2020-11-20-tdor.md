title: Transgender Day of Rememberance
---

Today is the Transgender Day of Remembrance ([TDoR][3]). On 11/20 every year we honor the memory of the transgender people whose lives were lost in acts of anti-transgender violence.

In the past year there have been over 430 trans and gender non-conforming people who have lost their lives due to hate. 430 people whose only crime was to be their true and authentic self every day.

My friend [Kelsey Campbell][1] over at [Gayta Science][2] put together this powerful visualization of the violence my community faces constantly. Please take a look when you can:
