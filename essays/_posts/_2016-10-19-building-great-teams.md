title: Building Great Teams
---

heesham actually I wanted to also get your advice on some things. since i’m in ops I’m managing several remote engineers I wanted to know what the best way was to manage them daily. we have daily scrums ,but I don’t think that’s enough

[5:49 PM]  
also, we have several projects running at the same time which I’m sure you guys do too (internal and client based projects) what do you do to make sure each is done on time? Devs and designers keep moving form one project to the next and my thoughts were to set complete dates for smaller tasks and enforce them (my approach to enforce is still being developed though)

[5:49 PM]  
and also set time frames through the week to work on those projects: like this project mon-tuesday this project tue - thurs etc.

jesssz hm

[11:13 AM]  
I led a fully remote team for three years and we have remote staff here too, so I’ve thought about this for awhile

[1:45 PM]  
jesssz I think your real problem is about motivation. You can’t expect deadlines and constant questions to produce results when someone is remote (or really when they’re not too)

[1:45 PM]  
you have to get them to intrinsically want to do it

[1:46 PM]  
I’ve been sharing these links with my leads recently, there are a few concepts that I think drive motivation pretty strongly

[1:47 PM]  
The first one is the concept of Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. Basically it’s a mental model to think about what motivates professionals. I’ve found it to be pretty effective. It was talked about in the book _Drive_ but I found this youtube video to be a little more accessible:

The other concept is 'Psychological Safety’. Google recently did a bunch of research on what makes the most effective teams. You may have heard of it, I’ve found it to be super important though. Some links:

As far as moving from task to task - we talk a lot about getting MVPs out before moving on. It’s basically just ground rules for working here. Ship something, then move on. The hard part is knowing when to ship, and so we talk about using feature flags, MVPs, etc a lot.

[1:51 PM]  
“on time” gets tough sometimes. It sounds like you might be a client-work-driven org, so dates get a bit easier (”we need to deliver project X by our commit of Y”). The challenge there is getting people bought in on that Y date. They 100% need to be a part of the process of defining it, or they need to trust whoever sets the dates completely

[1:51 PM]  
basically they need to be bought in on the possibility of doing X by Y

[1:51 PM]  
if not you’re just force-marching them to doom and that’s super demotivating

[1:53 PM]  
not sure I’d want to incur the context switching of spending half the week on one project and the other half on another.. I would expect you to have a big efficiency loss due to reloading folks’ brains

[1:53 PM]  
anyway.. lots of stuff there. I’ll probably blog most of that :wink: mind if I include your questions (anonymized) to set the stage?

heesham sorry for the late response got caught up with a major project. thank you for the advice and the links. I’ve read through googles project aristotle before and this extremely fascinates me, so again thank you for sharing.

the part that i found extremely interesting was temporal immediacy though. it’s the time between an action and the consequence and people weigh that out when thinking of speaking to someone in a higher position than them.

[12:11 AM]  
how often do you speak to your employees and how do you do it?

[12:12 AM]  
btw what’s your approach to psychological safety? how do you apply it

[12:12 AM]  
sorry for all the questions I’m just so extremely interested


jesssz yeah no worries

[12:03 PM]  
not sure what you mean with the time between an action and consequence and talking with someone in a higher position? Can you unpack that?

[12:04 PM]  
I have a 1-1 with everyone in my department at least once a quarter (currently ~70 people). I have monthly 1-1s with certain key people (dev leads - not direct reports of mine, and other individuals who I want to keep closer tabs on / make them feel heard). I do weekly 1-1s with my (5) direct reports

[12:05 PM]  
1-1s are generally structured much like Rand’s advice here: http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/

The Update, The Vent, and The Disaster
Business is noisy. Business is full of people worrying loudly about projects, process, and other people. These people have opinions and they share them all over the place — all the time. This collective chatter is part of the daily regimen of a healthy business, but this chatter will bury the individual voice unless someone… More

SUPER useful, definitely can’t imagine life without them

heesham Yeah, definitely. An example of temporal immediacy would be a nurse not telling a doctor, during a surgery, that he’d given the patient too much medicine because he/she feared they would get fired. The patient dies and the nurse feels guilty.

The voice that the nurse had of speaking out, during the surgery, was compromised by the thought of getting fired. That instant is the time between action and consequence.

[3:47 AM]  
I hope that better explains it.

[4:35 AM]  
heesham Great read! Really helpful on how to conduct the 1-1’s. Curious to see how you keep track of the 1-1 with 70 people and remember everything about them? Is there a system you have in place?


jesssz oh sure the nurse/doctor thing - that’s the example in the Psych Safety video, no? I think the key is to show that when you’re a leader you’re still vulnerable and human. You will make mistakes, so make sure you acknowledge that regularly with your team and set the expectation that you need their support just like you expect them to need your support. "To err is human" :slightly_smiling_face:
I’ve found that the essence of “being human” is what it takes to create psych safety. Empathize with your team and help them empathize with you too by getting to know you.

jesssz keeping track - ha, yeah I don’t remember everything! I try to remember a key point or two about folks - where they live, their families, what key interests they have outside work if I can. I ask them about those things in the 1-1, it helps them feel like I care about them (because I do!). Mostly I just try to remember it.. I probably should keep notes!
