This is a continuation of my blog post series on trying to use a Surface Book
as my primary computer. The first entry was [Surface Book]({% post_url 2016-11-23-surface-book %}) 
and the entry previous to this one was [A Surface Roadblock]({% post_url 2016-11-29-a-surface-roadblock %}).

### I give up.

I got so frustrated today trying to just deal with basic window management that
I said "well maybe I'll just try the mac again for a few minutes...". I'm not
going back. Nope. Can't make me do it.

This mac _just works_! Ugh! It does everything I need it to do and it gets out
of the way and lets me work. I'm too busy to spend time shaving all the stupid
yaks I'd have to shave to use that damn surface. And they're not _good_ yaks,
like dealing with [i3][1] or something, but annoying ones, like training my brain to
expect bad behavior from the window manager.

I'm even really liking the damn fuzzy mac text renderer. It's soft and
inviting, it feels good on my eyes. It's cozy. And it's _really_ legible.

Sure, typing my password is mildly annoying when waking up my computer, but if
I get the new MBP I'll get a fingerprint sensor so yay?

So ultimately I realized I really still want to be running linux and not
locking myself up with these damn companies but if I'm going to chain myself to
a desktop vendor it won't be Microsoft for a long time still.

My 16 years of not using Windows as my primary desktop OS has only been broken for about a week.

Oh god and vim just works again. Welcome back, beloved `"*`! Hello again,
iTerm! Homebrew, you crappy bastard, I even missed you.

### It's not all horrible

If you're not a developer you'd probably love the machine. If you're not used
to using the keyboard for _everything_ you'd probably be fine with Windows. If
you're just not picky about good window management maybe Win10's window manager
is good enough for you. The machine is bright and crisp, and the pen interface
is pretty interesting. If I were a fine artist or graphic designer I'd probably
love carrying what's effectively a [Cintiq][2] with me everywhere. The battery
life ultimately was pretty good. The 9-series nVidia graphics card was potent.
The tablet functionality was effective and interesting.

It's just not for me :)
