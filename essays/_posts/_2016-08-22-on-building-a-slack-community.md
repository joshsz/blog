title: On Building A Slack Community

(TODO this is raw notes to @tschaeffer in dctechslack. Maybe reformat)

joshsz hey Toby! Yeah I’d love to chat, will have to be a little slow on my end though, swamped with meetings today. I’ll write as I have time

[11:44 AM]  
First thing though - you should definitely start something for Nairobi! Nobody gave me permission, I just did it (with thought and consideration) and it’s worked out pretty well :slightly_smiling_face:

[11:46 AM]  
things I should cover (so I can come back later and type more): Code of Conduct, getting the word out, channel curation, engagement, dealing with trolls, http://rauchg.com/slackin/
rauchg.com
Slackin
I registered the Socket.IO channel on Freenode right after I started the project. Even though it was super easy to start, we still had a major problem: onboarding new people to IRC. It's [...]

tschaeffer Wow - thanks so much for the response Josh, really appreciate it!  That’s already very helpful, and understand you must have a very full schedule.  Would love to hear more from you as you have time!

[1:21 PM]  
joshsz so a code of conduct sends a message to the community that you have a set of standards and also gives you a backstop to work with if you ever have someone who’s misbehaving. There are a ton of great examples of codes of conduct out there, I suggest thinking through your community and how they’ll interpret your message and shaping it in that way

[1:22 PM]  
I’m using hubot ( https://hubot.github.com/ ) as a bot that can also share the Code as needed in a channel.. but I also have it published on dctechslack.com

[1:23 PM]  
so that’s the next thing -getting the word out. Initially I had dctechslack.herokuapp.com, which is a mouthful and not very memorable. It still exists (that url is where slackin (the thing I liked above) lives) but getting dctechslack.com gave me a more memorable url and also let me add some content to help folks understand what we’re all about

[1:24 PM]  
I’ve made some customizations to hubot you can see here too btw https://github.com/joshsz/dctech-hubot

dctech-hubot - Hubot for dctech.slack.com

tschaeffer Josh - this is great.  Looking forward to looking into your links and reading more.

[3:04 PM]  
It’s late here and am about to call it a night, but will follow up more tomorrow.  Thanks again for taking the time to respond and share your ideas - super helpful, and really appreciate it

joshsz ok let’s see, channel curation. Up to you on if you prefer to have people glom onto one or a few really big channels or separate out. I try for a hybrid here by setting a short list of ‘default’ channels and then saying ‘go make your own channels too’. It seems to work well, I just sometimes have to dig through the channel list for unused channels and archive them so folks don’t go into a dead room and expect content. I’ve written some additions to hubot to help me with that a bit but I’ll add more as I can too. Also that’s why I do the weekly channel highlight - to show folks that non-default channels get activity and to promote those subcommunities. It seems to have been helping!

[10:41 AM]  
Dealing with Trolls - I set up a small mod team and try to make sure they’re enabled to deal with this too, but the CoC here says to contact me so I get some DMs sometimes. Honestly it’s been really few (just like 2-3 over the last year). Mostly I just say “hey you’re being an asshat” to the offender and they stop, but I have had to ban one person. Slack made it easy to disable their account so it wasn’t hard. Most of the challenge here is the value judgment on whether someone is going to turn around. I try to err on the side of trusting folks and it seems to be working out so far

[10:44 AM]  
Finally, Engagement. This one is tricky because how do you, as one person, try to make sure that all however-many-people-you-have-logged-in are paying attention? I tried to make the content here useful to folks by setting up some helpful default channels, #meetups-and-events and #jobs probably being the most interesting for people to log in and check regularly. I’ve also tried to bolster certain people who seem to engage others often by contributing to conversations they kick off, I think that helps them feel like there’s someone on the other end of the line and makes it more likely that they’ll continue to build enthusiasm. Beyond that I just make sure that everyone I know and everyone I meet knows about dctechslack.com. Even if it’s only a fraction of folks who stay engaged, if more people try it then more will hit that fraction and stay :slightly_smiling_face:

Oh, one other thing - you should put your slack on any place that lists public slacks. Mostly I pay attention to slofile.com but I’m sure there are bunches more
