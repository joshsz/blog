### Open Source, Open Communities

Open source is really great. I wouldn't be where I am today without it.
We're all standing on the backs of giants. Think about it---if we hadn't
had the open-source movement, we'd all be paying thousands of dollars
for access to mediocre software that would allow us to write slightly
less mediocre software in carefully defined boundaries. I really love
open source.

I also love the communities that form around open-source. I would
definitely not know how to do what I do without the wholehearted support
of the communities I've been a part of.

### Ideastuff

Communities thrive on the open exchanges of ideas, especially when they
share their ideas with new people who question, challenge, and help
forge clarity. New people find groups through a variety of ways, but
they're much less likely to join if there's a cost involved.

Similarly, new people are less likely to seek out a new technology if
there's a cost to learn it.

Technology thrives on new ideas. Software itself is pure idea, and
without a free and open exchange of that stuff it tends to wilt and die.

### Access

All of us have benefited from free and open software, we all owe a debt
to the people who created it and to the communities who helped create
those people. I work hard to keep the meetups I'm involved with free
because I believe in freely giving back to the communities that have
gotten me where I am. I don't take sponsorships for The Ruby Hangout
because my costs are minimal, and I make an effort to keep in-person
event sponsorships limited to space, food, and other necessary costs.

The [Arlington Ruby Users' Group][3] has a really amazing mentorship
program. Experts freely give their time to help new people learn Ruby
and progress in their careers. These are highly skilled people who could
be billing a lot of money for their time giving it away for free.
Because they believe in what I believe.

### Paid Content

I heard about a meetup recently that charges for membership. There are
blogs you can only read if you pay. And there's at least one mailing
list that you can only get on with money. The paid content in each of
these is training material or access to the experts.

I don't begrudge people their right to make money, but I also don't like
putting up barriers to content. These barriers, if enough come around
(and there are decent monetary incentives to do so), could keep new
people from joining our communities. That could stop the flow of new
ideas into our discussions and could promote community rot.

### Free Communities

I believe in free, open-source software and free, open-source ideas. I
believe in community. I believe in growth and change and continual
improvement through continual re-examination. I believe new people with
new ideas are they only way to do that. Free communities are strong
communities. Strong communities create amazing software that I want to
use. Let's all do what we can to strengthen our communities.

If you sell training or help to developers, please be awesome and do
something like [Avdi's Postcard Offer][4]. Offer new people a way to get
in for free, help them out and they'll help you out eventually. Or even
better---spend time teaching new people for free. The [Learn Ruby
meetup][5] in DC is a perfect example of people spending their personal
time helping others level up. Let's grow our community together!
